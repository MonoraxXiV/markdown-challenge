#### You can always count on me when...
You are in trouble or need a second pair of eyes. I might not always know the solution, but I will help you by searching around with you.
If you need someone to talk to, I am always willing to lend an ear.

##### A funny story
I met my boyfriend irl for the first time while I was cosplaying V from Devil may cry 5 at facts. 
But before that we apparently met on final fantasy XIV where I proceeded to lecture him on the game for several hours.
While doing a dungeon together. I made him his favourite class' soulstone from the game for his birthday to remind him of it.
###### TL;DR
Met boyfriend while in cosplay, impressed him by being a know-it all.
